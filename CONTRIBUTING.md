Thanks for contributing to SeekMIDI!

First of all, our code of conduct restricts anyone involved in the SeekMIDI project from posting anything offensive, rude, hurtful, or in other ways unpleasant to others. This does not include technical criticism of design choices; otherwise, we never would get anywhere without feedback. Please watch your language when working on SeekMIDI!

Second, if you have the know-how and the time, you could check out the ["help-wanted"](https://github.com/oldtechaa/SeekMIDI/labels/help%20wanted) issues.

If you would like to help edit the wiki, please do so. Documentation is a tough task, so any help is appreciated.

If you would like to donate to the project, please email me at [oldtechaa@gmail.com](mailto:oldtechaa@gmail.com).

I would love emails from you if you plan to contribute on anything, but it's not strictly necessary.
