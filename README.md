### What is this repository for? ###

This is the home of SeekMIDI, a simple graphical MIDI sequencer offering multi-channel MIDI sequencing. Look at [Seq24](https://launchpad.net/seq24/) for a slightly heavier example of what we mean.
Written in Perl, SeekMIDI uses GTK+2 and Cairo to provide its GUI and MIDI-Perl to provide its MIDI handling system. We have released one version: 0.1.0. Please download it and try it out.
For the latest features, you can also use git to download the latest master. We aim to keep master somewhat stable so as not to have to release as often.

__Please keep in mind that SeekMIDI is still alpha software and features are constantly being implemented.__

### How do I get set up? ###

See [the wiki](https://github.com/oldtechaa/SeekMIDI/wiki/HowTo:-Install-and-Run).

We will soon have a full automated setup procedure for SeekMIDI. There are no plans to port it to Windows or OS X at this moment, although a third-party port would not be discouraged.
