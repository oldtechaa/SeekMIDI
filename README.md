### What is this repository for? ###

This is the home of SeekMIDI, a simple, lightweight MIDI sequencer.

### How do I get set up? ###

At the moment, full setup is not documented, but it should just be a matter of running "perl SeekMIDI.pl". Be careful if testing the current master, because an empty value in the GtkEntry will not allow the program to die correctly.
