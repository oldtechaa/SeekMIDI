### What is this repository for? ###

This is the home of SeekMIDI, a simple, lightweight MIDI sequencer.

### How do I get set up? ###

At the moment, full setup is not documented, but it should just be a matter of running "perl SeekMIDI.pl". Libmidi-perl and libgtk2-perl, or the equivalent on non-Debian systems, must be installed. An empty filename value may crash the program.
