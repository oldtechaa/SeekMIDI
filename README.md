### What is this repository for? ###

This is the home of SeekMIDI, a simple, lightweight MIDI sequencer.

### How do I get set up? ###

Dependencies:

 * libmidi-perl/perl-midi-perl on Debian/Arch respectively. perl-midi-perl must be installed from the AUR on Arch. For convenience on other distributions which do not package the library, the MIDI modules are provided in tarball form. Extract the tarball, then follow the README to install.

 * libgtk2-perl or its equivalent in other distributions. For example, in Arch, it is gtk2-perl.

 * perl5

Once set up, run "perl SeekMIDI.pl" in the folder containing SeekMIDI to run the program.

Please note: An empty filename value may crash the program.

Eventually, we would like to provide packages for MIDI-Perl, and provide a full automated setup procedure for SeekMIDI. Right now, we're working on more important things. We also eventually plan to port it to Windows, but that is low priority. There are no plans to port it to OS X at this moment.
