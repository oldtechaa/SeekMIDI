### What is this repository for? ###

This is the home of SeekMIDI, a simple graphical MIDI song editor offering multi-channel MIDI editing. Look at [Seq24](https://launchpad.net/seq24/) for a slightly heavier example of what we mean. Written in Perl, SeekMIDI uses GTK+2 and Cairo to provide its GUI and MIDI-Perl to provide its MIDI handling system. We have released one version: 0.1.0. Please download it and try it out.

### How do I get set up? ###

See [the wiki](https://github.com/oldtechaa/SeekMIDI/wiki/HowTo:-Install-and-Run).

Eventually, we would like to provide packages for MIDI-Perl, and provide a full automated setup procedure for SeekMIDI. Right now, we're working on more important things. We also eventually plan to port it to Windows, but that is low priority. There are no plans to port it to OS X at this moment.
